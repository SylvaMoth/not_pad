# not_pad

not_pad is a local Markdown notebook for thinking.

Each file is a single project or topic.  
New thoughts start at the top. Older thoughts drift downward.
That’s it.


## Why this exists
Most note apps assume you’re writing documents.
I mostly think in fragments, bursts, and half-formed ideas.


I wanted:
- something local
- something simple
- something that feels like Notepad, but biased for thinking
- a place to paste AI chats without organizing them first

So new thoughts go on top by default.
If I need context, I scroll down.

## What it is
- A lightweight editor
- Local-only
- Plain Markdown files
- One file per topic or project
- You can edit anywhere; it just starts at the top

## What it is not
- Not an IDE
- Not a second brain
- Not a sync app
- Not a productivity system

## Status
This is a personal tool.
It works for me.
It may or may not work for you.

If it’s useful, feel free to use it or improve it.
